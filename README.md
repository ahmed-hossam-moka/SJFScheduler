# Shortest Job First (SJF) Preemptive Scheduler - .NET Windows Forms

This is a simple Windows Forms application built in C# using .NET, which demonstrates the **Shortest Job First (SJF) Preemptive Scheduling Algorithm**, a core concept in Operating Systems.

---

## Features

-  Add processes with:
  - Process name
  - Arrival time
  - Burst time
- ‚öô Simulate **SJF Preemptive (Shortest Remaining Time First)** scheduling
-  Automatically calculate:
  - Waiting Time
  - Turnaround Time
  - Response Time
  - Average values for all metrics
-  Visual Gantt Chart to display execution timeline
-  Clear/reset inputs and chart for repeated testing

---

## Purpose

This project was developed as part of an **Operating Systems course** to provide a visual and interactive tool for understanding how SJF Preemptive scheduling works. It helps students:
- Observe how scheduling decisions are made in real time
- Learn about CPU scheduling metrics
- Gain hands-on experience with a Windows Forms-based simulation
